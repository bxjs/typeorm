# Defining entity schemas in json files

You can define an entity and its columns right in the model, using decorators. 
But some people prefer to define an entity and its columns inside separate files
which are called "entity schemas" in TypeORM.
In TypeORM you can define entity schemas as `js` or `json` files.

TBD.
